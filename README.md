# NHAI-Case-Study

For the problem statement, you need to identify the following things from the data: 
 
1.  Visualize the highway alignment within the Jupyter Notebook along with the location 
and labels of the Toll Plazas.  
 
2.  There have been reports that people have been able bypass toll-plazas on entry and 
it is leading to losses of revenue. There are two toll-able segments in the data 
(AB/BA) and (CD/DC). The toll is to be a deducted at the entry to a segment. 
Sometimes the toll-plaza lets some people go without deducting their entry or 
people have been able to find an unofficial bypass allowing them to skip and entry 
gate.  
a.  Investigate if there is any toll-leakage, if so at which segment/toll-plaza? 
b.  Number of trips which were possibly bypassed toll? 
c.  What is the possible revenue loss that is happening pertaining to those trips? 
 
3.  The speed of a particular vehicle on a particular stretch in a particular direction 
depends on multiple factors such as the traffic, vehicle type, condition of the road, 
direction etc.  
a.  From the data available, identify average/median/quartile speeds of vehicles 
on AB and CD stretches in each direction. 
b.  Does the speed vary by type of vehicle anywhere? 
 
4.  You have been provided data on the condition of the road LaneIRI values for each 
direction on the highway. Does the average speed calculated for all vehicles
